## What makes this project standout from the other community submissions?

At least on the backend side. There're several patterns that The Odin Project doesn't teach you, or I just over-engineered simply things:

- Custom errors for some HTTP status
- Unified route configs
- It uses TypeScript (I set up the project structure myself)

## Getting started

First, install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

To run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Before running the production server you need to build it:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the production server:

```bash
npm run start
```
